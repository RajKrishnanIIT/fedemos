# Running the Express App Locally

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v14 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) comes with Node.js

## Steps

1. **Install dependencies**

   Open a terminal in the project root and run:

   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**

   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. **View the app**

   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## File Structure

- `server.js` — Express server entry point
- `public/` — Static files (HTML, CSS, JS, lessons, demos)
- `package.json` — Project metadata and scripts

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors, make sure Node.js is installed and you are in the correct directory.
- For port conflicts, change the port in `server.js`.
